## Sense
There’s plausible biology (e.g., prostaglandins, oxidative stress) and several observational links.

## Nonsense
Most studies are observational with confounds. Effect sizes are small and inconsistent.

## Lesson
Risk ≠ panic. Use intentionally, talk to your clinician, avoid chronic/high doses without guidance.
